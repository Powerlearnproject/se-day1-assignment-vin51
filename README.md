# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the systematic process that involves design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.
-Importance- software engineering helps to power modern aspects of life through the creation of systems that help in the daily aspects of modern life, eg communication social media applications, online shopping - e-commerce websites.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languanges - FORTRAN
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requiremnt analysis- this phase basically involves gathering all the needed user and system requirements for docunmentation. 
Design- this phase is responsible for how the the system components will interact and how the system will function from the requirements gathered in the requirement phase.
-Implementation- this is the phase the code is now written to come up with the system.
-Testing- this focus on testing the system to ensure it is functional and meet the set standards.
-Deployment- after all the tests are successful, the system is deployed to the user environment for use.
-Maintenance- this phase involves mainting the system and making enhancement where needed in the future.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and a need for rigorous documentation, while Agile is better suited for projects that require adaptability and close collaboration with stakeholders.
scene: agile -Developing a mobile app in a rapidly changing market where user feedback drives ongoing development.
       waterfall - developing an e-commerce website with defined requirements.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
-Quality Assurance Engineer -  Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs- these are software environements that are used for writting, debbuging and testing code. eg Visual studio code
-VCS- these are softwares that are used for tracking changes that you make on the source code of your projects. eg Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Unrealistic requirements by management or clients - it is important to bridge the gap between management and software engineers so as to ensure realistic goals are set for project development.
-Time constraint - by providing a proper timiline for completion of the project then the software engineer will have ample time to curate the project as it is needed as opposed to when they are being rushed where by they will use shortcuts leading a sub-standard project delivered.
-Changing of requirements- with improved communication and regular review of project progress, it will be easy for a software engineer to be inline with the project goal which will lead to the sucess of the project.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-unit - focuses on individual components , usually functions or methods, to ensure that they work correctly in isolation.
   importance - Ensures that individual components are functioning as expected.
-intergration - ntegration testing focuses on the interaction between different components to ensure they work together as intended.
   importance -Helps validate the interaction between software and external systems like databases.
-system - System testing validates the complete and integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
  importance- Detects issues that might not be apparent when testing individual modules or integrations.
- acceptance -Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.
   imortance - Ensures that the software is ready for production and meets all business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt  engineering is crafting statements to get the best responses from ai models.
Importance - prompt engineering ensures that confusion is avoided by providing clear, specific and consice instructions to ge the best responses.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague prompt- What is Ai?
-Improved prompt- As a senior AI engineer describe what is Ai. Make the description as easy as possible so that even novices and professionals outside the technology field can understand.
-Reason - The improved prompt is effective since it has included a role and it is context based which will prompt the ai to give a clear and concise response.
